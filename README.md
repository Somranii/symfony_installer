# HOW DOES IT WORK

The symfony installer script is a simple bat file with multiple python scripts is made to ease symfony installation. 
The scripts follows these steps to finish :
* Install the required python libraries 
* Check **git** is installed and install it if not using **winget**
* Istall **powershell scoop** if didn't exist 
* Download and install **P 8.1** and add it automatically to **the path** if it didn't find any php version
* Download and install **php composer**
* Finally it installs **symfony**

And that is it.

**Thank you for using this script**

**Feel free to tell me what did you think about it and how I can improve**

**HAVE A LOVELY DAY**
